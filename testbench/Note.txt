The testbench files for TaPaFuzz in this directory are MIT licensed. Based on the tapasco-pe-tb testbench by Carsten Heinz.

A proprietary simulator is used for the testbench, since the PE makes use of Xilinx IP that can currently not be exported for Verilator.

The testbench setup scripts are still to be published (as part of the tapasco-pe-tb repo).
