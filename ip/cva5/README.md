# CVA5

CVA5 is a 32-bit RISC-V processor designed for FPGAs supporting the Multiply/Divide and Atomic extensions (RV32IMA).  The processor is written in SystemVerilog and has been designed to be both highly extensible and highly configurable.


The CVA5 is derived from the Taiga Project from Simon Fraser University.


The pipeline has been designed to support parallel, variable-latency execution units and to readily support the inclusion of new execution units.
